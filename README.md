## My process
1. I started with creating a style.css file and linked it in the head element of the. 
2. Created a clas named box so I can fit both paragraphs and image inside.
3. Created 2 seperate IDs for the 2 paragraph so I can style them separately.
4. Gave the html the proper width as it says in the style guide.
5. Change the color of the background to fit the solution.
6. Styled the box and the paragraphs to be equal to the requirements.
7. I added a media query to make the site fit for differrent screens, for which I used ChatGPT.
### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS
- ChatGPT

### What I learned

I learned how to adjust the viewing of the site based on the device an user sees it. 

I don't have full knowledge of what "@media" is, but I it take as an evolution anyway.

```css
@media (max-width:375px)  {
    .box {
        margin-left: auto;
        margin-right: auto;
        width: 80%;
        margin-top: 50px;
    }
}
```




### Continued development

For this project I've used basic knowledge and it took me about an hour to finish. A little too long for such a small project, but 
am proud of it anyway. This project made me realise how cool and beautiful web developing can be. 

I hope in the future I will find a team of my liking with which I can grow and develop great skills in this area.
